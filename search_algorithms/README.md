- Sorting algorithms are fundamental algorithms used to arrange elements in a particular order, typically in ascending or descending order. The efficiency of a sorting algorithm is often measured using Big O notation, which describes the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm. 

- Big O notation provides a high-level understanding of the growth rate of algorithms as the input size increases. It helps in comparing algorithms and making informed choices based on the expected efficiency requirements.
## Learning Objectives
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `search_algos.h`
## Functions
- **search_algos.h**,  header file
- **linear_search**,  function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm
- **binary_search**, function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm
