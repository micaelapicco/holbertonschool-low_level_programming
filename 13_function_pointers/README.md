## Learning Objectives
- What are **function pointers** and how to use them
- What does a function pointer **exactly hold**
- Where does a function pointer point to in the **virtual memory**

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should *end with a new line*
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- Your code should use the **Betty style.** It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use the *standard library*. Any use of functions like `printf, puts`, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- The **prototypes** of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called `function_pointers.h` Don’t forget to push your header file
