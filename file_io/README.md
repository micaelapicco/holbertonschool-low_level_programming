## Learning Objectives
- Look for the right source of information online
- How to create, open, close, read and write files
- What are file descriptors
- What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
- How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
- What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
- What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
- What is a system call
- What is the difference between a function and a system call
## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04` LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- You are not allowed to use **global variables**
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed syscalls: `read`, `write`, `open`, `close`
- You are allowed to use `_putchar`
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
- Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants `(POSIX)` vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read`(STDIN_FILENO, ...` vs `read(0, ...`
## man or help
- `open`
- `close`
- `read`
- `write`
- `dprintf`
